  <h2>What we do</h2>

  <p>
    TR3NTS was founded upon the principles of home cooking made with locally sourced ingredients, given an original twist.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where possible we make everything in house. A menu is available to download but it differs slightly according to venue.
  </p>

  <p>
    We serve breakfast and lunch indoors as well as serving street food from our trailer with its outside seating.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the morning customers that are in a hurry dashing to work we offer our Express Grab &amp; Go selection of sandwiches and pastries.
  </p>

  <h3>Our coffee</h3>

  <p>
    We have taken our coffee extremely seriously.
  </p>
  <p>
    L’Unico, the source of our coffee translates the unique, which coffee roasting Musetti with its very high standard manifests.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Musetti L’Unico is a fantastic blend of first class Arabica and Robusta coffee beans from Guatemala, Brazil, Colombia and Central America washed with a high proportion of Indian Robusta.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, thick full-bodied taste with soft, round flavors that provide the stable acid structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    That is why we use purified water, so we maintain Musetti’s smooth and clean taste.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Tea</h3>
  <p>
    All our teas are from fresh leaves sourced by the multiple award winner brand Teapigs.
  </p>

  <p>
    We pride ourselves with offering a large range of flavors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along with the favorites we also have teas, which change with seasons, please ask for our tea menu
    and our latest offerings.
