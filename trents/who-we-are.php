    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      TR3NTS takes its name from its owners.
    </p>

    <p>
      With time, this family of three has become a household name for the Leather Lane community.
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending over a decade opening successful restaurants for other companies, Aurora and Arthur took the plunge and opened TR3NTS in the heart of Leather Lanes 400 year old Market.
    </p>

    <p>It was February 2012.</p>

    <p>
      Before the days of TR3NTS, they often spend days walking around the narrow streets leading to Leather Lane Market and found a lack of nice places where you can sit back, relax and enjoy your surroundings without feeling pressurized to spend a fortune or scan each others dress code.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this thought in mind TR3NTS was born. A laid back spot where you can enjoy your morning coffee, breakfast or lunch.
